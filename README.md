# US Presidential Vote History

I collected historical results from US Presidential elections at the state and national level in order to create dashboards in Tableau that visualize how often states flip between elections.  
* [You can view the dashboards on Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/profile/lukas.wadya#!/vizhome/USPresidentialElectionFlipRates/Intro)
* **raw_data** contains table data saved from Wikipedia using the site https://wikitable2csv.ggor.de/
* **code** contains Jupyter notebooks used for cleaning the raw table data that is then saved to **data**
